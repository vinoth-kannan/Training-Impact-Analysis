# Training-Impact-Analysis

Here we have analyzed the impact of training for the employees of a particular company.
we have analyzed the impact of training by correlating the test performance and evaluation scores
of before and after the training of each and every employee across each department of the company.

Finally I have provided my final analysis report in form of Powerpoint presentation.
In the Powerpoint presentation, you can view my inferences from the dataset and conclusion in detail.
